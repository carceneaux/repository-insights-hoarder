# Github Action: Repository Insight Tracker

This GitHub Action updates the repository statistics including the number of stargazers, commits, contributors, traffic views, and clones.
The results are stored in a JSON or CSV file and committed to a specified branch in the repository.

1. Collects statistics on stargazers, commits, contributors, traffic views, and clones using the Github Rest API and GraphQL API.
2. Writes the statistics to a JSON or CSV file under `<directory>/<owner>/<repository>/stats.<format>`.
3. Commits the file to a specified branch in the repository.
4. Pipes the data as output to the next action, for further processing.

## 📗 Documentation

### 1. Generate a Github Token

The action requires the repository to fetch a Github token other than the one generated by the action itself, as it accesses traffic/views and clones. This access can only be granted through a private token.

To generate the token(s), follow the steps below:

1. Go to Github Settings in the upper right corner,

2. Go to Developer Settings,

3. [Generate a new fine-grained personal access token](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token)
    * Click `Generate new token`,
    * Give your token a descriptive name (e.g., `Repository Insights Token`),
    * Select the `Resource owner`
      * A fine-grained token can only interact with object of a single owner or organization. Not to worry as this action supports multiple tokens.
    * Set the `Expiration`
    * Set the `Repository access` set to `All repositories` or `Only select repositories`
      * For the latter, make sure to include the repository where the action is run and any repositories gathering insights from (if different).
          * Repository permissions
              * `Administration`: Read-only *(This is required for `insights_token`.)*
              * `Contents`: Read and write *(This is required for `commit_token`.)*
    * Click `Generate token`
    * Copy the token to your clipboard. You won’t be able to see it again.
4. Add the Token to Your Repository:
    * Navigate to your repository on GitHub.
    * Go to Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions > New repository secret.
    * Name the secret `INSIGHTS_TOKEN` / `COMMIT_TOKEN` (or another name of your choice).
    * Paste the token you copied earlier and click `Add secret`.


### 2. Add a workflow file

To use this action in your repository, create a workflow file (e.g., `.github/workflows/update-stats.yml`) with the contents below.

This is the minimum configurable parameters to run the job,
and will collect insights daily, on the repository that the workflow sits in,
and store these as a CSV file, on the branch repository-insights, in directory `/.insights/<owner>/<repository>/stats.csv`.

#### 2.1 Simple example

This example assumes you have the following repository secrets defined:

* INSIGHTS_TOKEN
* COMMIT_TOKEN

It will gather insights for the current repository and save the insights to the `repository-insights` branch in the `.insights` directory.

```yaml
name: Collect repository insights

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *' # Runs daily at midnight
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  update-stats:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Collect insights
        uses: carceneaux/repository-insight-hoarder@v1.0.0
```

#### 2.2 Example with gathering insights and storing them elsewhere

This example fetches insights from `carceneaux/repository-insight-hoarder` and saves the results in the `storage/storage` repository:

```yaml
name: Collect repository insights

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *' # Runs daily at midnight
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  update-stats:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Collect insights
        id: collect-insights
        uses: carceneaux/repository-insight-hoarder@v1.0.0
        with:
          insights_token: ${{ secrets.INSIGHTS_TOKEN }}
          commit_token: ${{ secrets.COMMIT_TOKEN }}
          owner: 'carceneaux'
          repository: 'repository-insight-hoarder'
          storage_owner: 'storage'
          storage_repo: 'storage'
```

#### 2.3 Example with gathering insights and storing them elsewhere

This example fetches insights from **all public** repositories belonging to `carceneaux` and saves the results in the `storage/storage` repository located in the `main` branch of the root directory in the JSON format:

```yaml
name: Collect repository insights

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * *' # Runs daily at midnight
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  update-stats:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Collect insights
        id: collect-insights
        uses: carceneaux/repository-insight-hoarder@v1.0.0
        with:
          insights_token: ${{ secrets.INSIGHTS_TOKEN }}
          commit_token: ${{ secrets.COMMIT_TOKEN }}
          owner: 'carceneaux'
          all_repos: 'true'
          storage_owner: 'storage'
          storage_repo: 'storage'
          branch: 'main'
          directory: '.'
          format: 'json'
```
